# Nand2Tetris Part I: Hardware

## Overview
Target: build a complete general purpose working computer from the ground up, hardware and software(in Part II)


## Project 00

Download the `Nand2Tetris Software Suite` to computer. The software suite includes all the software tools and project files that will be used throughout the course. After downloading, locate `file.txt` in the `nand2tetris/projects/00` folder on your computer. There is no need to understand or modify the contents of this file. Compress the file into a zip file named `project0.zip`.

Use the following bash command to compress `file.txt` to `project0.zip`

```sh
zip -r project0.zip file.txt
```


## Project 01 Boolean Logic
Building elementary logic gates like And, Or, Not, Multiplexor, and more

To run Hardware Simulator, first make `HardwareSimulator.sh` executable by `chmod +x HardwareSimulator.sh`

- primitive element: `Nand`
- `Not`: out = Nand(in, in)
- `And`: out = Not(Nand(a,b))
- `Or`: out = Nand(Not(a), Not(b))
- `Xor`: out = Or(And(a,Not(b)),And(Not(a),b))
- `Mux`: out = Or(And(sel,b),And(Not(sel),a))
- Muiti-bit Not,And,Or,Mux is similar
- `Or8Way`: tree like structure
- Demultiplexor(`DMux`, `DMux4Way`, `DMux8Way`, `Mux4Way16`, `Mux8Way16`): process channels independently

## Project 02 Boolean Arithmetic
Building a family of adder chips, culminating in the construction of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

- `HalfAdder`: sum = Xor(a,b), carry = And(a,b) 
- `FullAdder`: sum = Xor(c,Xor(a,b)), carry = Or(And(a,b), And(c,Xor(a,b)))
- `Add16`: connect FullAdders in sequence (can be optimized)
- `Inc16`: out = Add16(in,1)
- `ALU`: combine the chips designed before (The working principle of Hack ALU can be referred to in the lecture)

## Project 03 Sequential Logic
Building registers and memory units, culminating in the construction of a Random Access Memory (RAM)

- primitive element: `DFF`
- `Bit`: a multiplexer to choose the input (sel=load)
- `Register`: combine 16 DFF with load (Bit)
- `RAM8`: instantiate 8 16-bit Rgisters and use Multiplexer to control read/write according to address
- `RAM64`: instantiate 8 RAM8 and use Multiplexer to control read/write according to address(lower bits for Register, and higher bits for RAM8) 
- `RAM512`, `RAM4K`, `RAM16K`: Similarly, these chips are designed like a Russian doll system
- `PC`: change DFF to always load; use Mux16 to select out[t+1]


## Project 04 Machine Language
Learning a machine language and using it to write some illustrative low-level programs

- `Mult`: convert multiply to add through loop
- `Fill`: set the register at address to â€“1 through pointer (select 'no animation' in CPUEmulator to test this program)


## Project 05 Computer Architecture
Using the chipset built in projects 1-3 to build a Central Processing Unit (CPU) and a hardware platform capable of executing programs written in the machine language introduced in project 4

- `Memory`: Combine RAM16K, SCreen and Keyboard, read&write like a common RAM
- `CPU`: implement the CPU's data path and control path seperately according to the ISA manual
- `Computer`: connect ROM32K, CPU and Memory

## Project 06 Assembler
Developing an assembler, i.e. a capability to translate programs written in symbolic machine language into binary, executable code.
