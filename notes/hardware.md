# Nand2Tetris Part I: Hardware

## Overview
Target: build a complete general purpose working computer from the ground up, hardware and software(in Part II)


## Project 00

Download the `Nand2Tetris Software Suite` to computer. The software suite includes all the software tools and project files that will be used throughout the course. After downloading, locate `file.txt` in the `nand2tetris/projects/00` folder on your computer. There is no need to understand or modify the contents of this file. Compress the file into a zip file named `project0.zip`.

Use the following bash command to compress `file.txt` to `project0.zip`

```sh
zip -r project0.zip file.txt
```


## Project 01
Building elementary logic gates like And, Or, Not, Multiplexor, and more

## Project 02
Building a family of adder chips, culminating in the construction of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

## Project 03
Building registers and memory units, culminating in the construction of a Random Access Memory (RAM)

## Project 04
Learning a machine language and using it to write some illustrative low-level programs

## Project 05
Using the chipset built in projects 1-3 to build a Central Processing Unit (CPU) and a hardware platform capable of executing programs written in the machine language introduced in project 4


## Project 06
Developing an assembler, i.e. a capability to translate programs written in symbolic machine language into binary, executable code.
